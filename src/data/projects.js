    title: 'Lotukei High School Construction',
    shortDescription: 'Building a secondary school to serve the Didinga children of Lotukei sub-county.',
    story: `In the Didinga Hills of southeastern South Sudan, most children’s education ends at Grade 6. Not because they lack curiosity or ambition—but because the nearest high school is hours away, across difficult terrain, and families simply cannot afford the cost or the risk of sending their children so far from home. For girls, the journey is even harder: long walks on unlit paths, cultural pressures to stay home, and the fear that keeps many from ever returning to the classroom. We’ve listened to parents who want more for their children but have nowhere to send them, and to students who complete primary school only to find the next step out of reach.

The community of Lotukei has dreamed of a local secondary school for years. Parents, elders, and students have come together with Beti-Hari Society to turn that dream into reality. Construction is underway on a new high school that will serve grades 9–12 right here in Lotukei sub-county—bringing education to where the children are. The site was chosen in partnership with local leaders to maximize access for surrounding villages, and families have already begun preparing for the day their children can walk to high school instead of leaving home for distant towns.

The school will include classrooms, administrative offices, and basic sanitation. Beyond the national curriculum, we’re integrating vocational skills and life-skills training so students graduate ready to build livelihoods and lead their communities. Teacher training and community mobilization are running in parallel, so when the doors open, the foundation for quality education is already in place. We’re building not just a structure, but an institution that will serve the Didinga children for decades to come.

Local leaders have donated land, families have contributed labor, and the Ministry of Education has pledged support. What we need now is the funding to complete the build: materials, skilled labor, furnishing, and the finishing touches that make a school a place where young people thrive. The foundation is laid, the walls are rising, and the community gathers regularly to see progress—and to remind us that this school will change lives for generations.

We’re almost halfway to our fundraising goal. Every dollar brings us closer to the day when a child in Lotukei can walk to high school instead of choosing between an impossible journey and no education at all. Your support doesn’t just build a school—it builds a future for the Didinga children and the communities they will lead.`,

    title: 'Teacher Training & Development',
    shortDescription: 'Training and equipping dedicated teachers to deliver quality education in Lotukei.',
    story: `Behind every classroom in Lotukei are teachers who show up every day—often as volunteers, often without formal training—because they believe in what education can do for their community. They teach because they care. But caring alone isn’t enough. These educators deserve the tools, skills, and support to give every child the education they deserve. Many have never had the chance to learn modern teaching methods or how to adapt lessons for different learning styles, yet they persevere with limited resources and overcrowded rooms.

Our Teacher Training & Development program has been running since 2021, reaching current and aspiring teachers across Lotukei sub-county. We cover pedagogy, classroom management, subject knowledge, and inclusion—especially for girls and children who learn differently. Annual intensive workshops are followed by monthly mentorship and professional development, so growth doesn’t stop when the workshop ends. Teachers leave with practical strategies they can use immediately, and they return for follow-up sessions to refine their practice and share what works with their peers.

Participants learn how to create engaging lessons, manage large and mixed-ability classes, and support students who face challenges at home or in the community. We also focus on trauma-informed teaching—many children in the region have experienced displacement or loss, and teachers need the skills to create safe, supportive environments where learning can happen. The impact extends beyond the classroom: when teachers feel confident and supported, students stay in school, and parents trust that their investment in education will pay off.

One trained teacher touches hundreds of students over a career. The ripple effect of investing in educators transforms entire communities. We’ve already reached more than half of our funding goal, and the impact is visible: more confident teachers, more engaged students, and families who trust that school is worth their children’s time.

Your support trains the people who will shape the next generation of leaders in South Sudan. Every workshop, every mentorship session, and every resource we provide multiplies across countless classrooms and countless futures.`,

    title: "Girls' Education Support Program",
    shortDescription: "Removing barriers so every girl in Lotukei can access and complete her education.",
    story: `When a girl stays in school, everything changes. She learns to read and write. She understands her rights. She can pursue a livelihood, care for her family, and contribute to her community in ways that break the cycle of poverty. But in Lotukei, girls face barriers that boys often don’t: cultural expectations, lack of sanitary supplies, safety concerns on long commutes, and families who don’t yet see the value of investing in a daughter’s education. We’ve seen too many bright girls drop out after primary school—not for lack of ability, but for lack of support. That’s what we’re working to change.

Our Girls’ Education Support Program tackles these barriers head-on. We provide scholarships, sanitary supplies, and safe transportation support so girls can attend and stay in school. We pair students with female mentors—women from the community who’ve walked this path—and we work with families through awareness sessions to shift mindsets about girls’ education. The program is designed to address both the practical obstacles (cost, supplies, safety) and the deeper ones (family attitudes, community norms) that keep girls from continuing their education.

The mentorship component has been transformative. Girls meet regularly with women who have completed their education, run small businesses, or serve as community leaders. These mentors share their stories, answer questions, and help students envision a future beyond what they’ve seen. For many girls, it’s the first time they’ve heard someone like them say: you can do this. That message, repeated by someone who has succeeded, is powerful—and it’s one of the reasons we’ve seen enrollment and completion rates for girls improve since the program began.

Since we launched in 2022, we’ve seen more girls enrolling, attending regularly, and completing grades. The program runs year-round, including holiday sessions to keep momentum going. We’re not yet halfway to our funding goal, but every dollar we raise goes directly to keeping girls in the classroom—to scholarships, supplies, safe transport, and mentor stipends.

Invest in a girl’s education, and you invest in her future—and the future of her community. The change doesn’t stop with one girl; it extends to her family, her village, and the next generation she will raise.`,

    title: 'Community Classroom Expansion',
    shortDescription: 'Adding classrooms to existing primary schools to reduce overcrowding and increase enrollment.',
    story: `In Lotukei, primary schools are full—often overflowing. Children squeeze onto benches, share tattered textbooks, and teachers struggle to give each student the attention they need. Parents want to enroll their children, but there’s simply no room. The demand for education has outpaced the space to provide it. Class sizes that were once manageable have doubled or tripled, and in some classrooms, students take turns using desks or sit on the floor. Teachers do their best, but the conditions make effective teaching nearly impossible—and families know it.

Our Community Classroom Expansion project will add classrooms and basic furnishings at three primary schools identified for the highest enrollment pressure and strongest community readiness. We’ll also make critical infrastructure improvements: roofing repairs where rain leaks in, latrines where they’re missing, and furnishings so children can focus on learning instead of discomfort. Each new classroom will be built to national standards, with adequate lighting, ventilation, and space for movement—the basics that many of our current classrooms lack.

We’ve worked closely with school heads and community leaders to choose the sites. Each school has demonstrated strong local support—parents who will help with maintenance, teachers who are committed to growth, and students on waiting lists who are eager to start. The communities have also committed in-kind contributions: local materials, volunteer labor during construction, and ongoing involvement in school governance. This isn’t a project we’re doing to the community; it’s one we’re doing with them, and their ownership will ensure the classrooms are used and maintained for years to come.

Construction is planned for 2025, timed to the dry season to minimize disruption. Site assessments are underway. Once complete, hundreds more children will have a place in a classroom—and teachers will be able to teach effectively instead of managing overcrowding.

Every classroom we help by providing funds for bricks says to the community: education matters. Your support turns that message into reality. It gives a child a seat, a teacher space to teach, and a community proof that investing in education yields lasting returns.`,
