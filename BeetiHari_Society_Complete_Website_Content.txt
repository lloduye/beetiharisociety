## 📘 **About Us**

### **Our Organization**

Beeti Hari Society for Education & Economic Development is a grassroots nonprofit organization dedicated to building access to quality education, life skills, and essential community support services in rural South Sudan. Founded on values of purpose, service, and empowerment, we are working to uplift entire communities by starting where it matters most — in the classroom.

Our belief is simple yet powerful: when children are given access to nurturing, high-quality education, they can overcome poverty, realize their potential, and lead others toward a future of hope and prosperity.

We are committed to grassroots development that promotes dignity, self-reliance, and long-term sustainability.

## 🎯 **Mission & Vision**

### **Mission Statement:**

> “To provide superior academic and life skills development to young people, to foster spiritual and moral excellence for present and future generations, and to instill a sense of life purpose and active community involvement, to achieve universal child education.”

### **Vision Statement:**

> “Purpose-driven education that contributes to the development of mental faculties, spiritual, and character—that fosters a socioeconomically sustainable lifestyle, which will propel individuals and communities from endemic poverty to prosperity and abundance.”

We envision communities where children are nurtured mentally, morally, and spiritually; where education sparks self-sufficiency; and where knowledge becomes the key to building strong and vibrant societies.

## 🏫 **What We Do**

### **Expanding Educational Access**

Many children in rural South Sudan end their education at Grade 6 due to a lack of local resources. Our primary focus is to build classrooms and high schools near these communities so that young people — especially girls — can continue their education without having to travel long distances or cross borders.

We are building the future, literally — classroom by classroom — so that over **5,000–7,000 students** will have access to education in the next 5–10 years.

### **Nurturing Learning Environments**

We believe learning must be community-supported, spiritually grounded, and emotionally safe. Our schools provide students with an environment where they can grow intellectually and personally, and where their talents and values are recognized.

### **Holistic Development Initiatives**

Beyond education, our programs provide vital services, including:

* Basic healthcare support
* Socioeconomic development initiatives
* Microcredit and financial literacy training
* Parental and adult education
* Environmental awareness

These initiatives ensure that families and entire communities are empowered alongside their children.

## 💡 **Why Education Matters**

Education is about more than textbooks — it's about transformation.

### **Why We Do This Work:**

* **Meaningful Livelihoods:** Education leads to participation in trades, skilled labor, and other productive work.
* **Empowering Girls:** When girls understand their rights and future opportunities, they delay early marriage, avoid exploitation, and become leaders.
* **Protecting the Environment:** Educated children are more likely to conserve and respect their surroundings.
* **Building Safer Communities:** Education helps prevent youth involvement in crime, addiction, and idleness.
* **Hope for the Future:** When children learn, families and entire communities can begin to hope and plan for the future.

> “When you give the gift of education, you create lasting change.”

## 🌿 **The People We Serve**

### **The Didinga of South Sudan**

We work primarily in partnership with the **Didinga people**, an ethnic group of 160,000–200,000 living in the Didinga Hills and surrounding lowlands of southeastern South Sudan.

They are:

* Pastoralists and farmers
* Culturally rich and deeply connected to the land
* Highly valuing cattle — not as food, but as dowry and wealth
* Limited in access to basic services and education

Our commitment is to honor their values while working with them to build a future filled with opportunity through education and development.
