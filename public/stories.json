    "excerpt": "Nakang, a 15-year-old Didinga girl from the Didinga Hills, never thought she'd see the inside of a classroom. Today, she's one of our brightest students with dreams of becoming a doctor.",
    "content": "Nakang's family had never sent a child to school before. As traditional cattle herders in the Didinga Hills, education was seen as unnecessary. When we built our first classroom in her village, her parents were hesitant. But Nakang's determination changed everything. She walks 3 kilometers each day through the rugged hills to attend classes, and her grades are exceptional. 'I want to become a doctor to help my community,' she says with confidence that inspires everyone around her.",

'I want to become a teacher so I can help other children like me.'",
